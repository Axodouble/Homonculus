# Homunculus
A stupid discord bot I made in a morning using a locally hosted ollama instance for the fun of it.

## Usage

### Requirements
- Ollama compatible API endpoint.
- Docker (Preferred)

### Setup
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required fields.
2. Run the application, either using docker, the docker-compose file or running it locally.
